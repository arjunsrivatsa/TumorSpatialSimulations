# TumorSpatialSimulations
This script generates spatial coordinates of tumor cells based on evolutionary histories. You need to install msprime to generate a phylogenetic trees. Change the diffusion constant and image directory in the parameters file to your needs. There are four main methods: regular brownian motion, constrained brownian motion, ornstein-uhlenbeck motion, and brownian motion within a potential.
